= Proxy Server =
Instant Images routes all API requests to service providers (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, Openverse etc.) through our custom proxy server at [proxy.getinstantimages.com](https://proxy.getinstantimages.com).

Maintaining a proxy server for Instant Images allows us to keep API keys hidden from public view and ensures image data returned from the providers is returned in a normalized format for display in WordPress.
